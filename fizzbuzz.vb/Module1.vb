﻿' Fizzbuzz solution:
' Common problem statement is to test all numbers from 1 to 100, and if the
' number is a multiple of 3, to print the word "fizz", and if the number is
' a multiple of 5, to print the word "buzz". If the number is a multiple of
' both, then the program should print the word "fizzbuzz". Otherwise, print
' out the number.

    Sub Main()

        For i As Integer = 1 To 100

            ' i mod 3 AND i mod 5 having a false value means this number is not
            ' a multiple of either, therefore print the number.
            ' Note that a boolean test must be explicitly done to produce testable
            ' boolean values, as opposed to c, which only requires the values be 
            ' non-zero to satisfy truth testing.
            ' Also note that in Visual Basic, truth = -1, and false = 0
            If ((i Mod 3 > 0) And (i Mod 5 > 0)) Then    ' Most common scenario, is placed first.
                Console.WriteLine(i.ToString())
                Continue For    ' No need to test more factors, go to the next iteration of the loop.
            End If

            ' Inverting i mod 3's > 0 output results in "true" for factors of 3
            ' (i mod 3 for factors of 3 equals 0).
            ' Note that taking the non-inverted value of i mod 3 is equal to zero
            ' would have produced an equally true truth value.
            If Not (i Mod 3 > 0) Then Console.Write("fizz")    ' Second most common scenario, is placed second.

            ' The previous logic applies to the output of i mod 5 > 0 as well.
            If Not (i Mod 5 > 0) Then Console.Write("buzz")    ' Third most common scenario, is placed last.


            Console.Write(vbNewLine)    ' No test for factors of 3 and 5 simultaneously is needed

            ' If a number is a factor of 3 and 5, the execution will fall 
            ' through both of the if statements starting at line 33. As no end
            ' of line character (vbNewLine) is printed in either if statement, and
            ' because the test for being a factor of 3 is always done before the
            ' test for being a factor of 5, the resulting output is "fizzbuzz".
            ' 
            ' If a number is only a factor of 3 or only a factor of 5, the
            ' respective word will be printed, and the alternate if case ignored.
            ' In all cases where i is a factor of 3, 5, or both, the end of line 
            ' character is printed after the determination is made, allowing the
            ' calculation as to what text to print to be as short as possible
        Next

        Console.Read()    'Needs to be here to prevent the program window from immediately closing.
